# Stepper motor
INTRODUCTION 

Meaning-A stepper motor is an electromechanical system which is transducing an electrical signal into a mechanical
one. It is designed to accomplish a discrete movement (notion of step) and reach a
precise position.

Why to use stepper motor???

Stepper motors do not operate as DC or brushless motors. They have no integrated electronics, no brushes
and can be controlled in open loop. To get a quick idea, stepper motors are very often considered as particular brushless motor that can be controlled without feedback in open loop. Thus, even though stepper motor
may look a bit more difficult to understand technically, they have the advantage of being very simple to control and need no encoder or special driver to monitor the position of the rotor.
