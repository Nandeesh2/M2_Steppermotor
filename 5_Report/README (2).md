# Stepper motor
INTRODUCTION 

Meaning-A stepper motor is an electromechanical system which is transducing an electrical signal into a mechanical
one. It is designed to accomplish a discrete movement (notion of step) and reach a
precise position.

Why to use stepper motor???

Stepper motors do not operate as DC or brushless motors. They have no integrated electronics, no brushes
and can be controlled in open loop. To get a quick idea, stepper motors are very often considered as particular brushless motor that can be controlled without feedback in open loop. Thus, even though stepper motor
may look a bit more difficult to understand technically, they have the advantage of being very simple to control and need no encoder or special driver to monitor the position of the rotor.


When using a stepper motor?

Stepper motors are suitable for applications where compact and robust solutions are required. They develop
their maximum torque at stand-still which makes them naturally suitable to hold a position. The external
commutation ensures that the speed is perfectly constant even if the load varies. Thanks to the absence of
any electronic component, stepper motors run where the hall sensors or encoders of other type of motor
find their limit: high/low temperatures, external noise disturbances, etc.
Compared to a DC motor, a stepper motor is also much easier to use for positioning application as the notion of step enables the user to know the precise position or displacement of the rotor without feeback: it
runs in open loop.
Stepper motors are as a matter of fact frequently used when the following application requirements are
specified:
- Repetitive positioning tasks with high accelerations (i.e. XYZ of machine tools)
- Whenever the settling time must be short and with repeatable discrete positions.
- Whenever open loop (absence of electronics) makes sense (e.g. for noise immunity).
- For back and forth motions.
- Frequent “start/stop” operation.
- Whenever the duty cycle is relatively small. (Time ON << Time OFF)
- Whenever the actual position must be held with high torque.
- Whenever the actual position must be held when no current is applied (thanks to the residualtorque).
- Whenever long life times is required (i.e. using the brushless design).
- Whenever minor speed variation under load are not allowed (peristaltic pumps, XYZ of machinetools)
- For most small consumer electronic devices, such as hard disc drives, ink jet printers, cameras. 

Stepper motors categories 

There are basically three different stepper motor design types on the market:
- The permanent magnet (PM) design
- The variable reluctance design
- The hybrid design.

step angle

The step angle is the basis of the movement of a stepping motor.
the step angle depends on the total number of magnetic poles of the motor.
the step angle is determined by the formula:

Step angle = 360 degrees / N  where N = (NPH x PH)


Stepper Motor Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages:
1. The rotation angle of the motor is proportional to the input pulse.

2. The motor has full torque at stand still(if the windings are energized)
3. Precise positioning and repeatabilityof movement since good stepper motors have an accuracy of 3 – 5% of a
step and this error is non cumulative from one step to the next.

4. Excellent response to starting/stopping/reversing.

5. Very reliable since there are no contact brushes in the motor. Therefore the life of the motor is simply
dependant on the life of the bearing.

6. The motors response to digital input pulses provides open-loop control, making the motor simpler and less
costly to control.

7. It is possible to achieve very low speed synchronous rotation with a load that is directly coupled to the shaft.

8. A wide range of rotational speeds can be realized as the speed is proportional to the frequency of the inputpulses.

Disadvantages
1. Resonances can occur if not properly controlled.
2. Not easy to operate at extremely high speeds.
